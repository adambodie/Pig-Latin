# Pig-Latin
An example of converting words and sentences into Pig Latin using Haskell.

The rules for pig latin in this example are as follows
1. If the word begins in a consonant sound, the consonant cluster is moved after the word and "ay" is added
2. If the word begins in a vowel sound, "way" is added after the word.
3. 'y' is considered a vowel for simplicity sakes.
